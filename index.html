            <p style="color:lightskyblue;">Hi there.</p>
            <p>
                I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Auckland currently based in Whangarei. I have a passion for developing
                websites and web applications software with the goal of becoming full stack web developer.

        <h2>My story</h2>
        <div class="about">
            <p>I grew up in the beautiful city of Whangarei to chinese parents and have lived there most of my life. Ever since
                a young age, I have have always been interested and fascinated by technology but I also grew up with a low
                and passion towards designing stuff. Front-end design has always been part of what I want to do, I love to
                present stuff and learn visually; which is why I decided to build this website to express some of this design
                passion I have to compliment my ordinary resume on a word document.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most recently I have been living and studying Computer Science in Auckland at the University of Auckland. I really enjoyed the
                courses that involved designing web applications and web pages, these were the papers that stood out to me and found most fun to
                complete. Doing some interning work over the past 2017 summer at a local software start up called <a href="https://mahuta.io">Mahuta Digital</a> 
                only further who pursue this part of web development. Mahuta gave me the oppurtunitiy to carry over some of the skills I have learnt 
                while at university as well as introduce me to new technologies development in a commercial environment and work alongside me in gaining
                a greater understanding of these technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now with what I have learnt over the past three and a half years, I am ready to take this into the real world and continue learning. I am passionate about continuing to grow my
                repository of knowledge, overcome the adversities as a new graduate developer and challenge myself to bring a fresh take and perspective to 
                an industry I love and passionate about.
